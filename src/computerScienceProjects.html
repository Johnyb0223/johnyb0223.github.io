        <!--[First element in list]-->
        <li>
            <!-- [Decision Tree Link] -->
            <a href="https://github.com/Johnyb0223/DecisionTree">Decision Tree</a>
        </li>
        <!--[Decision Tree Description]-->
        <p>
            In this project, I will be implementing a classic machine learning algorithm, specifically a decision tree.
            The program I write will read in datasets from CSV files, using these datasets to generate a function that
            can make predictions based on data in the dataset. I will then use this function to make predictions and reflect
            on what it means to test a machine-learned function. To implement the decision tree, I will need to utilize
            object-oriented programming and recursion. This project will help me gain an understanding of how to test a
            machine-learned function and the implications of doing so.
        </p>

            <!-- [Doubly Linked List Link] -->
            <a href="https://github.com/Johnyb0223/LinkedList">Doubly Linked List</a>
        </li>

        <!--[Doubly Linked List Description]-->
        <p>
            For this project, I will be analyzing the differences between mutable and immutable Linked Lists when extended with a
            remove operation. I will be examining the memory diagrams, implementations, and runtime analysis of both types of lists
            in order to understand their differences. I will be creating a program that implements a Doubly Linked List, then analyzing
            the performance and memory usage. Additionally, I will be adding private fields for improved performance, good OO design,
            and testing the interacting methods of the Linked List. Upon completion, I should have a better understanding of how to
            implement (mutable) lists, how lists work in memory, and how to analyze the runtime of programs.

    Hello! I'm Jonathan, a junior studying Computer Science. My primary interests lie in the development of computer
systems, computer application design, and mathematics. My past military experience has equipped me with highly
developed leadership skills, as well as the capacity to collaborate with others in an effective manner. In addition,
working in an academic research environment has given me the opportunity to hone my communication abilities, both
written and verbal.

    Above all, my curiosity drives me towards learning and exploring new concepts and ideas!

    Through coursework and personal interests, I have built a solid foundation in computer science. My programming skills
consist of multiple languages such as Java, Python, and C++, as well as a solid understanding of fundamental concepts
such as recursion, time complexity, and various programming paradigms. I understand the importance of producing
efficient programs and have experience in constructing complete test suites to make sure an application satisfies its
specifications. I am looking to expand my computer systems, relational database, and UI/UX skills through personal
programming projects. I am searching for internship/work oppurtunities that provide a solid mentor-mentee relationship,
as I believe that learning from professionals with industry experience is an optimal way to improve my comprehension of
concepts and ideas.
